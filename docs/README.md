# Koltic

[Koltic](www.example.com) is a programming language designed to be rigorous during compilation. It has a built-in compilation tool called the Koltic Compiler. Koltic itself is compiled into bytecode targeted for the [LightVM](https://github.com/soteenstudio/lightvm) virtual machine.

Koltic itself draws syntax inspiration from [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) and [JavaScript](https://javascript.com), adopting Kotlin's strictness and adding unique features.
